# go-argcheck
###Simple Go argument preconditions checker.

This minimal library allows to embrace [Fail Fast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fail-fast) paradigm, by providing a set of functions to check preconditions and do validations on arguments. Whenever a precondition is not met, a panic will be thrown.
